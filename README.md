# Hi, I'm Sam 👋

🎓 Computer Science Student | 💻 C++ & DSA | 🏗️ System Design | 🧠 Machine Learning

I am a computer science student focused on building strong fundamentals in
algorithms, systems, and scalable software design. I learn concepts from
first principles and validate them through rigorous implementation.
