# Hi, I'm Sam 👋

🎓 Computer Science Student | 💻 C++ & DSA | 🏗️ System Design | 🧠 Machine Learning  

I am a computer science student focused on building strong fundamentals in  
algorithms, systems, and scalable software design. I learn concepts from  
first principles and validate them through rigorous implementation.

## 🔧 Technical Focus
- Data Structures & Algorithms (C++, interview depth)
- Low-Level & High-Level System Design
- Multithreaded and memory-aware C++
- Backend request flow & system internals
- Machine Learning fundamentals and implementation

---

## 🧠 Currently Working On
- Advanced DSA in C++ (brute → optimal with reasoning)
- Multithreaded in-memory key-value store (Redis-like)
- System design–level social media feed
- Machine Learning (Codebasics + documentation + math intuition)
- Computer Networks & Operating Systems (interview-focused depth)
